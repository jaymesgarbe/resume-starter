                It's the 52nd week of Song of the Week, which means it has now
                been a whole year since I started this! This is truly just a
                passion project for me that I admittedly haven't put a ton of
                effort into otherwise. I have loved making this more interactive
                and I have some more plans that I just do not have time to
                execute right now. For now, enjoy this confetti and an embedded
                spotify playlist (it took me half of the day to code it into the
                site lol). Thank you all for your earnest participation in this
                little project, I hope you have taken something away from this
                at the very least. Anyways, enjoy today's regularly scheduled
                SotW.

              I've never actually heard Buck Meek sing solo until this very
              song, yet I've seen him play in person for his band Big Thief.
              This voice of his is not something I would've expected from him by
              first glance but it makes me smile a lot when I think about it. He
              also talks about Siskyou and Shasta county in this song!

            <h2>Overall Review</h2>
            <p id="overall">
              Last night Google News greeted me with Pitchfork's review of Buck
              Meek's recently-released solo album, "Haunted Mountain". With an
              impressive rating of 7.2, I just HAD to give it a listen (though I
              usually take Pitchfork's ratings with a grain of salt). This album
              feels almost like an extension of his band's work, something I
              would never disapprove of. This is my favorite track so far, the
              title track is also really good. Give this one a listen and please
              listen to the whole album if you're into it!! Make it a great
              week.

          <h2>SOS - SZA</h2>
          <p id="celebOverall">
            This week I sat terrified at how a new album after a hiatus of 5
            years could possibly compete with what I consider the gold-standard
            of modern R&B records, "Ctrl". SZA answered on Friday with an
            eclectic diary-like record of ranging emotions over ranging genres
            with a tracklist nearly doubling her triple platinum sophomore
            release. SZA diverts the path of expectations in such a grandiose
            fashion that it is impossible to collate these projects. The
            constant shifting of moods and genres (and the fact that she does
            them all so masterfully) keep the hefty 23-song tracklist from
            becoming monotonous. As expected, her off-the-shoulder songwriting
            amazes on every track through which she is able to maintain a few
            common motifs throughout. Her lyrics keep the album from sounding
            like a collection of randomly produced songs, a fault to which many
            other experimental albums fall victim. Most have thoughtlessly
            labeled this album as R&B/Pop due to SZA's past successes in this
            genre. I now struggle to consider SZA solely an R&B artist and find
            it completely unjust to slap this common epithet on "SOS". This
            album displays expansive talent in sonic styles never before heard
            from SZA and I just hope it can sate me for the time between now and
            her next project. Thank you.

          <h2>Overall Review</h2>
          <p id="celebOverall">
            I’ve recently been listening to Dominic Fike’s new album on repeat
            (especially since I saw him in concert!). I could have chosen
            virtually any song from this album to be my song of the week, but I
            have a particular love for this one lately. The play-on-words title
            refers to a childhood crush or lover who is said to have had a
            sheltered upbringing, but grows up to do big things. Fike reminisces
            about that relationship in a time before their lives became more
            complicated, and he introduces an additional sentiment about the way
            that technology has impacted our lives and interactions with others.
            The production has a lot of subtle detail, and I really love the
            guitar parts throughout this whole album. I find this song really
            sweet and the lyrics always make me smile.
