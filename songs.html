            <p id="favPart">
              While I usually pick out a specific sonic element to praise for
              this section, my favorite part about this song is the way it makes
              me feel. It's every collective summer night passing by, but
              finding a moment of peace in that rapid passing of time. I can't
              explain why it has this effect on me, but I hope you feel it too.

            <h2>Overall Review</h2>
            <p id="overall">
              Firstly, the bridge halfway into this song sounds like a Mort
              Garson composition, listen to any song from "Mother Earth's
              Plantasia", it's so etherial. As far as this track goes, I could
              talk for hours. Although it's not contending for a spot in the top
              5 tracks from "Blonde" (10/10 album) because of its one-note
              nature, it does that one note superbly. "Summer's not as long as
              it used to be" is not only my favorite lyric from this song, but
              also sums up its storyline pretty well. The distortion of time is
              felt with both the lyrics and melody, both desired and undesired.
              This distortion is particularly effective in my impatient waiting
              for summer. As I listen to "Skyline To" repeatedly while writing
              this review, I'm also repeatingly talking myself down from the
              massive FOMO of missing Frank Ocean's Coachella performance in
              about 5 hours. Listen to this song, you will understand.

          <h2 style="font-size: 30px" id="title">Album Review</h2>
          <h2>SOS - SZA</h2>
          <p id="celebOverall">
            This week I sat terrified at how a new album after a hiatus of 5
            years could possibly compete with what I consider the gold-standard
            of modern R&B records, "Ctrl". SZA answered on Friday with an
            eclectic diary-like record of ranging emotions over ranging genres
            with a tracklist nearly doubling her triple platinum sophomore
            release. SZA diverts the path of expectations in such a grandiose
            fashion that it is impossible to collate these projects. The
            constant shifting of moods and genres (and the fact that she does
            them all so masterfully) keep the hefty 23-song tracklist from
            becoming monotonous. As expected, her off-the-shoulder songwriting
            amazes on every track through which she is able to maintain a few
            common motifs throughout. Her lyrics keep the album from sounding
            like a collection of randomly produced songs, a fault to which many
            other experimental albums fall victim. Most have thoughtlessly
            labeled this album as R&B/Pop due to SZA's past successes in this
            genre. I now struggle to consider SZA solely an R&B artist and find
            it completely unjust to slap this common epithet on "SOS". This
            album displays expansive talent in sonic styles never before heard
            from SZA and I just hope it can sate me for the time between now and
            her next project. Thank you.

          <h2>Overall Review</h2>
          <p id="celebOverall">
            Last time I did csotw, I reported on maybe one of the best songs
            ever written. So this time I figured id just cover this silly little
            bop I've been back into recently (lk thanks to a tiktok micro
            trend). I love this song because you can really feel the amount of
            fun the artists had recording it. It manages to feel moody and a
            little expressive while still remaining light hearted and upbeat
            thru its use of raunchy metaphors and catchy melodies, mimicking the
            sound of crying during the chorus. Lyrically, it just doesn't take
            itself that seriously, almost adapting a dissociative, laissez faire
            attitude towards the perils of a relationship. Sonically the song is
            aggressively fast paced, always keeping your interest. The song
            really does feel like that classic alt/punk pop an angsty
            protagonist would make in a coming of age movie and I love it.
