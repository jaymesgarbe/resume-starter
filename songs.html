              The buildups to the choruses distribute the pacing of this song
              and keep it from falling flat. Beabadoobee's voice is at its PEAK
              here and the lyrics are so amusing. There is so much to love about
              this song.

            <h2>Overall Review</h2>
            <p id="overall">
              A year after the heat wave of success that was her hit single
              "death bed" in early 2020 and her closely followed album "Fake It
              Flowers", Beabadoobee subtly released an EP titled "Our Extended
              Play". Despite being a quaint 12 minutes long, the 4 tracks are
              cohesive and build on each other; they transport you. It is
              extensively reminiscent of early 2000's pop-punk (even the album
              cover). "Cologne" has this conceited overconfidence that
              encapsulates the pop-punk style. I love this kind of
              world-building in a song, it greatly heightens the experience. I
              hope you enjoy this one, and please make it a great week!

          <h2 style="font-size: 30px" id="title">Album Review</h2>
          <h2>SOS - SZA</h2>
          <p id="celebOverall">
            This week I sat terrified at how a new album after a hiatus of 5
            years could possibly compete with what I consider the gold-standard
            of modern R&B records, "Ctrl". SZA answered on Friday with an
            eclectic diary-like record of ranging emotions over ranging genres
            with a tracklist nearly doubling her triple platinum sophomore
            release. SZA diverts the path of expectations in such a grandiose
            fashion that it is impossible to collate these projects. The
            constant shifting of moods and genres (and the fact that she does
            them all so masterfully) keep the hefty 23-song tracklist from
            becoming monotonous. As expected, her off-the-shoulder songwriting
            amazes on every track through which she is able to maintain a few
            common motifs throughout. Her lyrics keep the album from sounding
            like a collection of randomly produced songs, a fault to which many
            other experimental albums fall victim. Most have thoughtlessly
            labeled this album as R&B/Pop due to SZA's past successes in this
            genre. I now struggle to consider SZA solely an R&B artist and find
            it completely unjust to slap this common epithet on "SOS". This
            album displays expansive talent in sonic styles never before heard
            from SZA and I just hope it can sate me for the time between now and
            her next project. Thank you.

          <h2>Overall Review</h2>
          <p id="celebOverall">
            I discovered this song from the Cal Berkeley student radio about 2
            years ago just in time for summer and it has not left my playlist
            ever since. While a 9.7 rating is incredibly high this song truly
            deserves it, it encapsulates the vibe of summer and especially
            summer love in a way that effortlessly floats up to your ears. The
            song was gorgeously produced with this funky beat that somehow
            sounds both retro and futuristic with the lyrics to tie it all
            together wonderfully. The lyrics definitely play into the summer
            vibe as the chorus reads “it’s the summer, and I’m at it again, she
            my lil thing, gets me outta my jam”. As you listen to this song you
            yearn for a day at the beach and if your lucky enough to be at the
            beach, well, you’re in for a treat. While I will be the first to
            admit I am far from knowing all of the intricacies of music and
            especially what correlates into good music so I will refrain from
            going in depth about the musical elements of this song but, that
            does not mean I do not know a good song when I hear one. This song
            has been one of my favorites for a long time and everyone I play it
            for always loves it too, so I ask you next time you’re on aux expand
            someone’s playlist with this one!
