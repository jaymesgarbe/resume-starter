              The "chime-y" nature of this song gives it a holiday feel to me,
              the very beginning even sounds like "Silent Night" to me. The bass
              throughout the background of this song is really soothing and easy
              to listen to in the background while doing just about anything
              else. If you want to really listen to it though, the brass, piano,
              and percussion that alternate in the foreground are rather
              entertaining.

          <h2 style="font-size: 30px" id="title">Album Review</h2>
          <h2>SOS - SZA</h2>
          <p id="celebOverall">
            This week I sat terrified at how a new album after a hiatus of 5
            years could possibly compete with what I consider the gold-standard
            of modern R&B records, "Ctrl". SZA answered on Friday with an
            eclectic diary-like record of ranging emotions over ranging genres
            with a tracklist nearly doubling her triple platinum sophomore
            release. SZA diverts the path of expectations in such a grandiose
            fashion that it is impossible to collate these projects. The
            constant shifting of moods and genres (and the fact that she does
            them all so masterfully) keep the hefty 23-song tracklist from
            becoming monotonous. As expected, her off-the-shoulder songwriting
            amazes on every track through which she is able to maintain a few
            common motifs throughout. Her lyrics keep the album from sounding
            like a collection of randomly produced songs, a fault to which many
            other experimental albums fall victim. Most have thoughtlessly
            labeled this album as R&B/Pop due to SZA's past successes in this
            genre. I now struggle to consider SZA solely an R&B artist and find
            it completely unjust to slap this common epithet on "SOS". This
            album displays expansive talent in sonic styles never before heard
            from SZA and I just hope it can sate me for the time between now and
            her next project. Thank you.

          <h2>Overall Review</h2>
          <p id="celebOverall">
            This song has been a favorite of mine for a while and I would give
            it a 10/10 honestly, except the visuals and vocals are nothing
            exceptional (although the video reportedly had no budget). Strictly
            the song however, it’s perfection. Production-wise, it somehow
            sounds both slightly industrial and late 2010s-indie/bedroom pop at
            the same time; it’s almost reminiscent of SZA’s “Hit Different” but
            with a lesser RnB feel. Lyrically this song achieves what I consider
            to be a perfect balance, feeling both specific and meaningful to the
            artist while also being open to individual interpretation. The
            events Sky Ferreira herself experienced to write this song are
            clearly being chronicled here, yet the lyrics are relatable enough
            that there is more meaning to be gleaned from them upon further
            listens as we project our own experiences onto them. The New York
            Times described it as “counterintuitive and brilliant,” I couldn’t
            agree more. It succeeds at everything a song could hope to achieve
            all at once. The bridge after the second verse in particular is some
            of the most beautiful lyricism and performance I’ve ever heard. I
            would say this song is pretty experimental, especially considering
            its initial release in 2012. That being the case, I encourage giving
            it a few listens before a final judgment to let its intricacies
            really shine!
