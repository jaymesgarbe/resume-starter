            <h3>SUHSD Information Technology Dept. | Summer Intership '22</h3>
            <h4>Synopsis:</h4> 
            <p>
              For the three months of my summer, I worked 40 hour weeks plus overtime assisting
              my former high school district's IT department with multiple software 
              development projects.
            </p>
            <h4>Projects:</h4>
          <dl class="projects">
            <dt>Data Metric</dt>
            <dd>I tore into an existing Virtual Machine that was used for displaying
              the amount of tickets our department had to accomlplish on a monitor 
              within our office. We use a new service, FreshService, to track these
              tickets, and the VM was pulling from the deprecated service. My coworker and I 
              wrote a Powershell script to pull tickets and devices from SUHSD services using my SPSFreshService 
              and SPSImmyBot modules I built prior. The data is arranged contingent to 
              InfluxDB, a time series database that we pipe out ticket data into. 
              A pipeline containerizes our code using Docker, and sends it to the
              VM which runs every 10 minutes. We finally built a Grafana instance
              to query and display our InfluxDB data on the monitor.
            </dd>
            <dt>SPSFreshService/SPSImmyBot</dt>
            <dd>Using the FreshService API documentation, I built my first
              fully fledged powershell module that queries tickets, agents, requesters,
              departments, and most other data that our department stores within FreshService.
              The module is able to create new instances of each object, update existing objects,
              and collect groups of items based on many different parameters. I then built a similar
              module based around the ImmyBot service. 
            </dd>
            <dt>Clever Toolkit</dt>
            <dd>I was tasked to build a Chrome Extension to add modularity to the service
              Clever. I worked in Javascript, CSS, and HTML, all languages I had little 
              prowess in prior. I used a popup that allows the user to add, delete, 
              show, and hide columns of Application data displayed on the Clever Developer
              portal. 
            </dd>
            <dt>Aeries-FreshService Sync</dt>
            <dd>Using my SPSFreshService module and the public AeriesApi, I pulled
              the data of all the teachers in our district and compared their similar 
              attributes, overwriting the FreshService entries with the much more populated 
              and trustworthy Aeries entries.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <h4>Miscellaneous Skills:</h4>
          <dl class="projects">  
            <dt>Powershell</dt>
            <dd>I knew nothing of the Powershell language before starting this
            job. I've learned nearly as much about the basics of the Powershell language in these three
            months than I learned about Python my first year at college. I even began to dive into 
            slightly more advanced concepts that Powershell allows such as dynamic variables, Pester testing,
            and logging.
            </dd>
            <dt>Azure DevOps</dt>
            <dd>My partner and I worked almost solely within the Azure Devops environment.
            I learned a ton about using Azure boards for project cooperation, Azure Pipelines for 
            automation of numerous different tasks, and, of course, Azure Repos for all the lovely version 
            control. I was also introduced to Virtual Machines, Azure SQL, and used Azure Virtual 
            Desktop to do some overtime from home. 
            <dt>Google Workspace</dt>
            <dd>I worked a lot with the Google APIs Explorer, as well as Google Apps Script for automation 
              of all of my applications. My final project, Clever Toolkit, introduced me to the Chrome Developers
              environment as well.
            </dd>
            <dt>Teamwork</dt>
            <dd>The most valuable thing I learned this summer was how to program as part of a team.
              It became second nature to document my code thoroughly, and I would never make a commit to 
              the main branch without peer review of a pull request or something of that manner. I 
              learned Pair Programming in school, and my partner and I used it often to work through bugs 
              or complex issues that we could not figure out by ourselves.
